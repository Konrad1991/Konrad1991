# Hi, I'm Konrad

I'm passionate about R, C++, numerical optimization, data science, and machine learning. 
I enjoy building tools that bridge R and C++, optimizing computations, and exploring new ways to enhance scientific workflows.

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming: R, C++, Go and Fortran
- Scientific Computing: Numerical Optimization, Data Science, Meta programming
- Software Development: Mostly R packages, C++ libraries, and Shiny apps

## Featured Projects
### R & C++
- [**ast2ast**](https://github.com/Konrad1991/ast2ast) - Translates an R function into a C++ function callable from R.
- [**dfdr**](https://github.com/Konrad1991/dfdr) - R package for computing derivatives of functions.

### Applied Projects
- [**Thermosimfit**](https://github.com/ComPlat/Thermosimfit) - Optimizing parameters in thermodynamic models.
- [**OpenStats**](https://github.com/ComPlat/OpenStats) - A Shiny app for statistical analysis.
